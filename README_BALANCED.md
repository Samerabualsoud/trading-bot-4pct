# Balanced AI Trading Bot (RECOMMENDED)

## üéØ Overview

This is the **recommended version** that balances signal quality with quantity.

### **Why Balanced?**

The "Maximum Performance" bot had **17 filters** which made it too conservative (might generate only 5-10 trades/day instead of the target 15-20).

The **Balanced Bot** uses:
- ‚úÖ **7 proven critical fixes** (tested strategy)
- ‚úÖ **Lower confidence thresholds** (55-65% instead of 65-75%)
- ‚úÖ **Realistic expectations** (15-20 trades/day, 5-7% daily ROI)
- ‚úÖ **Not over-optimized** (avoids curve-fitting)

```python
'tier1_min_confidence': 60,  # Was 55
'tier2_min_confidence': 65,  # Was 60
'tier3_min_confidence': 70,  # Was 65
```

### **If Too Few Trades (5-10/day):**

**Decrease thresholds by 5%:**

```python
'tier1_min_confidence': 50,  # Was 55
'tier2_min_confidence': 55,  # Was 60
'tier3_min_confidence': 60,  # Was 65
```

### **If Win Rate Too Low (<65%):**

**Increase thresholds by 5-10%** to be more selective.

### **If Win Rate Very High (>80%):**

**Decrease thresholds by 5%** - you're being too conservative and missing opportunities.
