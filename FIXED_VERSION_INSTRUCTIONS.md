# Fixed Debug Version - Instructions

## What Was Fixed

I've created **`ai_bot_maximum_8pct_debug_fixed.py`** that fixes:

1. **Unicode Error** - Removed ✓ character that caused encoding issues on Windows
2. **Added Symbol Loop Logging** - Shows exactly when symbol analysis starts
3. **Added Error Handling** - Catches any exceptions during symbol processing
4. **Better Debug Output** - Shows which symbol is being processed

## How to Use

### Step 1: Pull Latest Code

```bash
cd C:\Users\aa\trading-bot-4pct
git pull
```

### Step 2: Stop Current Bot

Press `Ctrl+C`

### Step 3: Run Fixed Debug Version

```bash
python ai_bot_maximum_8pct_debug_fixed.py
```
