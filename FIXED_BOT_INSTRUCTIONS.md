## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **This is a TESTING Version!**

**Filters disabled:**
- ❌ Trend filter (temporarily)
- ❌ Volatility filter (temporarily)

**Why?** To ensure signals are generated and we can verify the bot works!

**Once working:**
- Re-enable filters one by one
- Adjust thresholds based on win rate
- Fine-tune for optimal performance

---

## 📈 Tuning After Testing

### **If Win Rate is >75%:**
- **Increase thresholds** by 5% (being too conservative)
- **Re-enable trend filter**

### **If Win Rate is 60-75%:**
- **Perfect!** Keep current settings
- **Re-enable filters gradually**

### **If Win Rate is <60%:**
- **Increase thresholds** by 5% (too aggressive)
- **Enable trend filter immediately**
